# My config files for tmux, neovim, and zsh shell


1. Clone into folder of your choice, I usually keep it in the home directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/IliaOzhmegov/dotfiles.git
```
2. Launch `update.sh` script, it will create softlink from files into corresponding folder of `.config` folder
```
./update.sh
```
